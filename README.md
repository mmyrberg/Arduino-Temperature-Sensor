# Arduino-Temperature-Sensor
Full-stack IoT integrated solution where a temperature sensor, connected to an Arduino Uno board, is sending data to a web service (Spring Boot backend) which logges the values (Hibernate) in a mySQL database (Planetscale cloud DB) and serves a web-based dashboard (Thymeleaf).
